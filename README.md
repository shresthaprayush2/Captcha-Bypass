# CaptchaExtractor
This project is a Python-based web automation script using Selenium and Tesseract OCR to automate the login process on a website that requires CAPTCHA input. The script captures CAPTCHA images, processes them to enhance readability, and then uses OCR to extract the text, enabling automated CAPTCHA-solving and login.
